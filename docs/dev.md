# Portanic Development Documentation

## Stack

Portanic is build using the following technologies:

- Go
- Echo
- Templ
- HTMX
- PostgreSQL
- sqlc

## Running portanic locally

At the moment the entire project can be setup with

- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up

These commands are also wrapped in the justfile, so you can instead do

- just build
- just up

When changes are made to a templ file we additionally need to run

- templ generate

## Working with sqlc

All files in `internal/db` are generated by sqlc, do not edit them directly.
Instead, edit either `sqlc/queries` or `sqlc/schemas` depending on the type of change you want to make.
Then run

```
sqlc generate
```

or

```
just sqlc
```

to update the files in `internal/db`
